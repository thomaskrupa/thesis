### :blue_book: PhD dissertation Appendix C: `R` code   :blue_book:

`R` functions and code for the PhD dissertation of Thomas Krupa (University of Gdansk) @[`github.com/thomaskrupa/thesis/`](https://github.com/thomaskrupa/thesis/).

>  This directory contains `R` code for data preparation, NSBM requirement checks, calculation of the NSBM approach, statistical methods and OLS regression.

This Github directory of the Appendix contains all of the `R` codes of this dissertation which are divided into six parts.

* First, the R codes for preparing the database is described (see folder `0_preparation`). 
* Then, the R codes for checking the NSBM requirements is presented (see folder `1_requirements_nsbm`). 
* After that, the NSBM package is described. This package contains one primary and 13 secondary functions and is executed by two main functions (see folder `2_nsbm_approach`).
    * With the help of NSBM and constant return to scale technology it is possible to calculate technical efficiency.
    * It is also possible to use varying return to scale technology and internal structures. 
    * This makes it possible to calculate pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency (source efficiency) as well as production efficiency and investment efficiency (divisional efficiency).
* Fourth, the R codes for the statistical methods are presented. The statistical methods are distinguished between the life and non-life insurance sector (see folder `3_statistical_methods`). 
* Fifth, the R codes for the second stage analysis are described (see folder `4_OLS_regression`).
    * The R codes are divided between life and non-life insurance.
* Finally, there are some R codes that are not so important and therefore only uploaded to Github (`5_miscellaneous`).
