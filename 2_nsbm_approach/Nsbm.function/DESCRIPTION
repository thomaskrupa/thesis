Title: Calculation of efficiency with the Network slack-based measure (NSBM) approach
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Thomas Krupa <t.krupa@hotmail.de>
Maintainer: Thomas Krupa <t.krupa@hotmail.de>
Description: The nsbm function can calculate efficiency by using the NSBM approach. Different variants can be 
    used such as direction (e.g. non, input or output), return to scale variant (e.g. CRS or VRS) or network variant 
    (e.g. fix or free constraint). It is also possible to calculate the efficiency for one division (K=1) and no 
    network.
